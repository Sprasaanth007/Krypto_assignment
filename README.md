I have implemented the homepage and wishlist page alone.
We can click on the add to wishlist button and the products will be added to wishlist, the same can be checked out by clicking on the wishlist link
I wasn't able to implement the other features due to lack of time.

//////
Run the following commands:
npm install
npm start

This will spin up the project in localhost:3000
